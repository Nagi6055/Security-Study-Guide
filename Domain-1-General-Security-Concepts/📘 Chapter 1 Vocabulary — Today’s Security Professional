1. Core Cybersecurity Objectives

Confidentiality — Protecting information from unauthorized access.

Integrity — Ensuring information isn’t altered without authorization.

Availability — Ensuring information and systems are accessible when needed.

CIA Triad — The trio of confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

Non-repudiation — Guarantee that a party cannot deny an action, supported by digital signatures.

AAA (Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting) — Access control framework.

2. Security Controls

Categories

Technical Controls — Automated controls enforced by systems.

Managerial Controls — Policies, risk assessments, governance processes.

Operational Controls — Day-to-day human procedures (training, awareness).

Physical Controls — Barriers and devices that protect hardware, facilities, and people.

Types

Preventive Controls — Stop incidents before they occur.

Deterrent Controls — Discourage hostile actions.

Detective Controls — Identify when events occur.

Corrective Controls — Fix or mitigate issues after detection.

Compensating Controls — Alternative options when primary controls aren’t feasible.

Directive Controls — Policies or procedures that guide behavior.

3. Security Concepts & Models

Zero Trust — “Never trust; always verify” approach to access.

Gap Analysis — Identifying the difference between current and desired security posture.

4. Change Management & Risk

Change Management — Formal process to control changes to systems/processes.

Risk Categories (Strategic, Compliance, Operational, Financial) — Types of risks organizations face.

5. Data States

Data at Rest — Stored data.

Data in Transit — Data moving across networks.

Data in Use — Data currently being processed.

6. Cryptographic Fundamentals

Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) — Framework for managing digital certificates and keys.

Encryption — Process of encoding data.

Symmetric Encryption — Same key for encrypt/decrypt.

Asymmetric Encryption — Public/private key pairs.

Key Exchange — Process of sharing cryptographic keys.

Hashing — One-way transformation for integrity.

Salting — Adding random data to hashes for security.

Digital Signature — Cryptographic signature for non-repudiation.

Tokenization — Replace sensitive data with tokens.

Data Masking — Obscuring data to protect privacy.

Blockchain / Open Public Ledger — Distributed, tamper-resistant records (integrity concept).

Certificate Authorities (CA) — Trusted entities that issue certs.

Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) & OCSP — Mechanisms to revoke certs.

7. Physical Security Terms

Bollards, Fencing, Lighting — Examples of physical safeguards.

Access Badge / Badge Readers — Physical access systems.

Security Guard / Video Surveillance — Human and tech monitoring.
